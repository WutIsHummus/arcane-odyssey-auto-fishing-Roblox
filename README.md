# Requirments
##### pip install PyAutoGUI
##### pip install opencv-python
# What to do?
##### Download png and py file and put them into a folder
##### In your folder, run py this_1.py
##### Then it will ask you how long you want to run your program. Go to a fishing spot which your character wont be able to move (so like a wall behind your back) and just cast your rod once and you should be good.
